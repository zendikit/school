# Introduction

The purpose of this catalog is to bootstrap reading ability to expedite consuming Japanese material.

This catalog is not exhaustive. There is grammar in the Japanese language not present here. Also, for grammar points presented here, there are nuances not covered.

While certification such as that provided by the [JLPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test) is not indicative of language mastery, the various JLPT levels do provide a
convenient way to organize practical grammar points. Here we provide a catalog of grammar by approximate JLPT level.

Grammar points in each level are presented in [alphabetical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goj%C5%ABon).

## Prerequisites

You must know the kana. Also, while we try to use relatively simple vocabulary in the example sentences, you should understand the
[general-use kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji)--if not the readings then at least the meanings to intuit the gist of the example sentences.

## References

We recommend _A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar_, _A Dictionary of Intermediate Japanese Grammar_, and _A Dictionary of Advanced Japanese Grammar_, all by Makino and Tsutsui, as supplements.
