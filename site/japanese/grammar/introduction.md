# Introduction

The purpose of this reference is to reinforce reading ability to expedite consuming Japanese material.

This reference is not exhaustive. There is grammar in the Japanese language not present here. Also, for grammar points presented here, there are nuances not covered.

## Organization

While certification such as that provided by the [JLPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test) is not indicative of language mastery, the various JLPT levels do provide a
convenient way to organize practical grammar points. Here we provide a catalog of grammar by approximate JLPT level.

Grammar points in each level are presented in [alphabetical order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goj%C5%ABon).

## Prerequisites

You must know the kana. Also, while we try to use relatively simple vocabulary in the example sentences, you should understand the
[general-use kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji)--if not the readings then at least the meanings to intuit the gist of the example sentences.

## How to Study this Reference

Study this material with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). There is no need to scrape or copy content from this website. Instead, use `to_csv.py` to convert `grammar.json` into a CSV file that Anki
can import. For instructions on doing this, see the [tool documentation](https://github.com/zendikit/school/tree/master/material/japanese/grammar). We do not provide pre-generated CSVs at this time.
