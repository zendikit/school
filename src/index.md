# Zendikit School

Education is an investment in the betterment of the present and future of the
human condition. We take no money from you, and in return we confer no degree.
We are interested only in growing skills backed by deep understanding. All
material is project-based where practical. Participation requires that you are
self-directed, have a computer, and have internet access.
